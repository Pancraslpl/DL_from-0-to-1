# DL_from-0-to-1
This is the record about learning DL, and will give you the basic guidance how to improve your ability!

Firstly, I learned the book 'Python编程 从入门到实践', this gives me deep-understood about how to code by using python,and know the basic logic of python.
Secondly, as you know, I feel like a native python coder after reading the book, so I continue to read the book '深度学习入门 基于Python的理论与实现'.
Now, I will give the summary about the book, by the way, I really recommed the book to the students who are the fresh-man about DL.
